With a **character-level vocabulary**, on the other hand, the token \"t\" must contribute to representing every word containing it, such as \"time\", \"the\", and \"train.\" This forces a single token's parameters to hold a vast amount of contextual information, making it difficult for the model to learn representations that capture precise meaning.\n",
